                        The Buffalo
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The African buffalo is a large sub-Saharan African bovine. The Cape buffalo is the typical subspecies, 
                        and the largest one, found in Southern and East Africa. The forest buffalo is the smallest subspecies, 
                        common in forest areas of Central and West Africa. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The adult African buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous 
                        bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a "boss". It is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous 
                        animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates it gores, tramples, and kills over 200 people 
                        every year.

                            The African buffalo is not an ancestor of domestic cattle and is only distantly related to other larger bovines.

                        Its unpredictable temperament may have been part of the reason that the African buffalo has never been domesticated, 
                        unlike its Asian counterpart, the water buffalo. Adult African buffaloes have few non-human predators aside from lions 
                        and large crocodiles. As a member of the big five game, the Cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy in hunting.
