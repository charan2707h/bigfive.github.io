                        The Elephant

                    <p>
                        The African elephant is a genus comprising two living elephant species, 
                        the African bush elephant and the smaller African forest elephant. 
                        Both are social herbivores with grey skin but differ in the size and color of their 
                        tusks and in the shape and size of their ears and skulls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both species are considered at a heavy risk of extinction on the IUCN Red List; as of 2021, 
                        the bush elephant is considered endangered and the forest elephant is considered critically endangered. 
                        They are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a 
                        threat in several range countries as well.

                            African elephants are highly intelligent. They have a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, 
                            a trait they share with humans, apes, and some dolphin species. They are amongst the world's most 
                            intelligent species.

                        With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), the elephant brain is larger than that of any other terrestrial animal. 
                        The elephant's brain is similar to a human brain in terms of structure and complexity; the elephant's cortex 
                        has as many neurons as that of a human brain, suggesting convergent evolution

                        Elephants exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, art, play, 
                        a sense of humor, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory, and possibly language. 
                        All of these behaviors point to a highly intelligent species that is thought to be equal to cetaceans and primates.
