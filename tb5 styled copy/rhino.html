                    The Rhinoceros
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rhinoceros, commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of the five extant species of odd-toed ungulates 
                    in the family Rhinocerotidae. Two of the extant species are native to Africa, and three to South and Southeast Asia.
                </p>

                    Rhinos are some of the largest remaining megafaunas: all weigh at least one tonne in adulthood. 
                    They have a herbivorous diet, one or two horns, and thick (1.5â€“5 cm), protective skin formed from 
                    layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure. 
                </p>

                    <quote>
                        Rhinos have the ability to ferment food in their hindgut.

                    Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths; 
                    they rely instead on their lips to pluck food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, rhinoceros are killed by poachers for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market for 
                    high prices, leading to most living rhinoceros species being considered endangered. 
                    The market for rhino horn is overwhelmingly driven by China and Vietnam to use in traditional Chinese medicine 
                    among other uses. A market also exists for rhino horn dagger handles in Yemen, which was the major source of 
                    demand for rhino horns in the 1970s and 1980s.
