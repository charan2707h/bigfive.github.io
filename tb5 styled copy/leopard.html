                <h2>
                    Leopard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The leopard is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae. 
                    It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, 
                    and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss 
                    and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. The leopard is considered locally 
                    extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, 
                    Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, 
                    Tajikistan, Vietnam, and Israel. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. 
                    Its fur is marked with rosettes. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar but has a smaller, lighter physique, 
                    and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed, and without central spots. Both leopards and jaguars 
                    that are melanistic are known as black panthers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behavior, broad diet, strength, 
                    and ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. 
                    It can run at speeds of up to 58 km/h (36 mph).
