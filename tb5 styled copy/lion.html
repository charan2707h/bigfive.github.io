                <p>
                    The lion, often called "the king of the jungle", is a big cat. 
                    A group of lions is called pride and is led by a male lion. 
                    The female lions are called lionesses and are the main hunters of the pride and caretakers of the cubs.

                    Lions can be found in most game reserves in Africa and some parts of Asia. The lion is a muscular, 
                    deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears. 
                    Its fur varies in color from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. 
                    The colors of the underparts are generally lighter.

                        A newborn lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood. 
                        Although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.

                    The white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism which is caused by a double recessive allele. 
                    It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. 
                    White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park 
                    and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. 
                    They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. 
                    Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015.
